# MIPS-mini-processor-simulator
The objective of this project is to simulate how an instruction goes through a datapath in MIPS.

Use the following commands to run the code 

gcc -o spimcore spimcore.c project.c
./spimcore input_file.asc or ./spimcore input_file2.asc

After these two commands enter one of the following commands
s
r
m
halt
x

These commands do the following 
s- do the next step in the program
r- view registers
m- view memory
halt- check if a halt has occured
x- exit the program
